# Source code that solve the 2D incompressible Navier Stokes system with a pressure corection algorithm.

MAIN_cavity.py contains the set up an recall the function to solve the equations
Solver.py contains the algorithm 

To run the code put the two files in the same folder and run MAIN_cavity.py

python MAIN_cavity.py
ipython MAIN_cavity.py
